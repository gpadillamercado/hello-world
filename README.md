Ideas and learning
Hello! 

I'm Gil. Generally interested in applying R to create useful scripts/pipelines for analysis of biological data.

Many of the data I encounter from biochemistry and molecular biology experiments are usually are measured and read via a computer. This potentially results in an Excel sheet, csv, or another data structure. I use these data in trying to understand data structures and principles in data management, wrangling, and analysis.
